      What does it take to innovate?
      Innovation is much like any other creative act.
      It takes raw material and a process for shaping that raw material into value.
      We believe that person-centered insight is the raw material of innovation.
      But insight does not come easy - it must be "earned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Earned insight is just the raw material - a mere starting point for innovation.
      Converting insight into innovation requires a rigorous problem-solving process.
      Ask yourself two questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have we earned our insight?</li>
      <li>Do we have a process for converting insight into innovation?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At Veros Advisors, our mission is to help organizations answer yes to both of those questions.
      We enable organizations to earn their insight and we provide the tools and support needed to convert their insight into innovation.
